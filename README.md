Android app for fetching nearby places via Google.

FetchPlace searches for locations nearby your GPS location. You can manipulate with the name or address of the location and take pictures of the place.
Locations are searched by Google services.
Pictures are uploaded using Flickr REST service. Thanks to Flickrj-android for making my life easy (https://code.google.com/p/flickrj-android/).

TODO:
	-draw route from user location to the found nearby location
	-button to user Flickr album
	-whatever you want
	
Hope it help someone. Enjoy.
